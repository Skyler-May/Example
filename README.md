# Detailed description:

Problem 1
This project uses a nested navigation structure: top-level Stack â†’ middle-level Tabs â†’ inner Stack.
In this sample project, I rely on the innermost stack layout to display a back button in the header. However, the header's back icon is rendered incompletely.
I'm not sure whether this is a bug in SDK 53.0.7 or caused by something else.
Notably, this issue did not appear in SDK 52. (See screenshots 1â€“4 in the project.)

Problem 2
When using the innermost stack layout, after initializing the project, switching between Tabs screens causes the header to visibly shake (jitter) vertically.
(See the video in the bug folder of the project repository.)

Request
Please help provide solutions or workarounds for the two issues described above.
Thank you!
